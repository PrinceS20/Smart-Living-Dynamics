ðŸ’¡ Smart Home Automation System â€“ IoT + Machine Learning + Computer Vision
This project is a final year capstone built to demonstrate how IoT, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision can work together to create a smart, touchless home automation system. The system automates the control of lights and fans based on room occupancy and allows users to control appliances using hand gestures, enhancing accessibility and energy efficiency.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Occupancy Detection:
Utilizes IR and ultrasonic sensors with Arduino to count people entering/exiting a room. Based on occupancy, the system turns lights/fans ON or OFF automatically.

Gesture-Based Control:
A Machine Learning model developed using Python and OpenCV recognizes hand gestures through a webcam. Users can control appliances with simple hand signsâ€”no need for physical switches.

Serial Communication:
The gesture recognition system communicates with the Arduino via serial ports, linking ML predictions with hardware actions.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used:
Python

Arduino 

OpenCV

IR & Ultrasonic Sensors

Serial Communication

ðŸ“Œ Project Goals:
Automate common home appliances using real-time inputs

Promote energy-saving and accessibility

Demonstrate integration between hardware (IoT) and software (ML)

This repository contains the full codebase, including circuit diagrams, ML model scripts, and integration logic. Ideal for students and developers interested in smart home systems, embedded computing, and AI-powered automation.
